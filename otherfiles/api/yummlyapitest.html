//next steps: Double Check how you would code the api (such as getting rid of numbers in teh front of the sentence). How would you code this??
//make an if/else statement that if a recipe does not have a number in the front you would make the code randomize again
//read up about reference regex (regular expression) numbers only- check week4 (hangman game) checks variables that all of them are numbers
